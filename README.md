## Overview
This provides detailed instructions on how to set up and operate a Balboa 32u4 robot using a PID controller to achieve stable balancing for more than 10 seconds. The Balboa 32u4 robot is a versatile, high-performance platform suitable for advanced robotics projects.

## Documentation
- **Balboa 32u4 User Guide**: A comprehensive manual is available at [Pololu's website](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J70) and the detailed PDF version can be downloaded [here](https://www.pololu.com/docs/pdf/0J70/balboa_32u4_robot.pdf).
- **Arduino Balboa-32u4 Library**: The required Arduino library for Balboa 32u4 is accessible at [Pololu's GitHub repository](https://pololu.github.io/balboa-32u4-arduino-library/).
- **Arduino LSM6 Library**: For the LSM6 sensor, use the library available at [Pololu's GitHub repository](https://github.com/pololu/lsm6-arduino).
- **PID Controller**: The PID control for this application is inspired by, and adapted from, the [Arduino PID Library by Brett Beauregard](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library). Note that our implementation is simplified and customized specifically for this balancing task.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Arduino IDE Installation**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **User Guide Reference**: Refer to the "5.2 Programming using the Arduino IDE" section in the Balboa 32u4 User Guide for detailed setup instructions.
3. **Library Installation**: Ensure that the "Balboa32U4" and "LSM6" libraries are installed in the Arduino IDE via the Library Manager.
4. **File Placement**: Place the `PID_lib.cpp` and `PID_lib.h` files in the same sketch folder as the `.ino` file.
5. **Compilation and Upload**: You are now ready to compile the sketch and upload it to the Balboa 32u4 robot.

## Operation Procedure
1. **Battery Check**: Ensure that the batteries are fully charged for optimal performance.
2. **Programming**: Compile the program and flash it onto the Balboa robot.
3. **Initial Setup**: Place the robot on a flat surface with the Raspberry Pi visible from above. Turn on the robot using the Power button, indicated by a blue light and a startup sound.
4. **Calibration**: Press the Reset button for calibration. A specific sound from the buzzer will signal readiness. Repeat this step if you change the balancing surface.
5. **Start Balancing**: Press the "A" button to initiate the balancing program. A yellow LED will illuminate to indicate that the program is active.
6. **Balancing in Action**: Position the robot upright. It will balance itself, signified by the activation of both yellow and red LEDs.
7. **Safety Feature**: If the robot tilts below 45 degrees, the motor will automatically turn off, though the program continues to run.
8. **Pausing the Program**: Press the "A" button again to pause the program. A red LED will light up to indicate this state.

This is aimed at providing a professional and clear set of instructions for setting up and operating the Balboa 32u4 robot with a PID controller for balancing tasks.
